### Got too many files?
- MAKE SOME MORE!

## What it Does:
- prompts the user for a directory
- prompts the user for a number to increment the file copy
  - e.g., 1 = every file, 2 = every other file, 3 = every third file, 10 = every tenth file, etc
- copies a portion of the original files to a sub-directory

### How We're Using This:  
- Photogrammetry!
  - took too many photos and need only a portion?  Get a portion!


### FEATURES
